# Trump for President, 2024 Inc. -- All Media Related Disbursements

To identify all possible media-related disbursements in the Trump campaign's spending data, line items were filtered where the term "media" appeared in any of the relevant fields: `recipient_name`, `disbursement_description`, or `disbursement_purpose_category`. 

This approach ensures a comprehensive capture of expenditures linked to media activities, regardless of whether the spending was designated under a particular vendor, specific description, or categorized purpose.

In the data analysis, there was a line item labeled under "Strategic Media Services," but upon closer examination, it was specified as a "polling expense." This item was removed from the media spending dataset since polling does not fall under the category of media-related activities like ad buys or content production. Polling serves as a standalone category of campaign expenditure focused on gathering public opinion data, which informs strategy but does not involve the direct creation, production, or distribution of media content. Excluding this line item helps ensure the media spending analysis accurately reflects only those expenses directly tied to campaign messaging and media engagement.

Conversely, travel expenses for media production firms hired by the Trump campaign were included in the media-related spending data. These travel expenses are directly linked to the production process, as media production often requires on-site work such as filming or managing live events. Since these travel costs are essential to the completion of the final media product, they are relevant to include in a comprehensive view of media spending, capturing the full range of expenditures that contribute to media production and distribution.
