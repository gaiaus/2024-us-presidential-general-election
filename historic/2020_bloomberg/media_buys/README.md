# Mike Bloomberg 2020, Inc. -- Media Buys
Core Campaign Period: November 2019 - March 2020 (Bloomberg dropped out March 4, 2020)

*Note*: Some expenses after March 2020 appear to be residual payments/settlements

**Why This Data Matters**

Bloomberg's 2020 primary campaign represents a fascinating (*truly degenerate*) outlier in political campaign spending analysis. Despite never reaching the general election, Bloomberg's campaign executed one of the most concentrated and intensive media spending efforts in U.S. political history, investing $641.9M over just 100 days (averaging $6.42M daily).

Most presidential campaigns build spending gradually over 18-24 months. Bloomberg's campaign compressed typical presidential campaign spending into roughly 100 days (November 2019 - March 2020), creating a unique natural experiment in the relationship between concentrated media spending and electoral outcomes.

Bloomberg's FEC filings are notable for their unusual level of specificity in categorizing media expenditures. While most campaigns use broad categories like "media buy" or "placed media," Bloomberg's filings detail specific channels:

"TV ADVERTISING"
"DIGITAL ADVERTISING"
"PRINT ADVERTISING"
"RADIO ADVERTISING"
"BILLBOARD ADVERTISING"

**Spending Analysis**

Average daily spend during peak (Jan-Feb 2020): ~$7.9M per day

Highest single-day total: Feb 21, 2020 with $77.6M (primarily TV) with concentrated spending in Super Tuesday states.

**Media Mix Strategy**
* Television Dominance: 74.2% of budget; focused on national buys. Heavy saturation in key markets
* Digital/Social: 20% of budget; split between established platforms (Facebook/Google) with custom digital media placement through (Hawkfish)
* Direct Mail: 4.6% of budget; used for targeted voter outreach alonside supplemented broadcast strategy
* Traditional Print/Radio: less than 2% of media buys. Mainly used for targeting local markets and minority media outlets
